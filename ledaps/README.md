Ledaps auxiliary files

    http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/auxiliaries/ledaps_auxiliary/ledaps_aux.1978-2014.tar.gz

See git tag [ledaps-version_2.6.0]

### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries - ESPA product formatter (https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-product-formatter)
  * Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.
```
    export PREFIX="path_to_directory_for_ledaps_build_data"
```

  * Install baseline auxiliary files.  Please note that the original ozone data has data gaps in 1978 (actual data starts on Nov. 1, 1978), 1979 (partial), 1993 (partial), 1994 (partial), 1995 (complete gap), 1996 (partial), 1997 (partial), 1998 (missing DOY 347+), 2008 (missing Sept. 28/29), ...  You will want to run the updatetoms script (described later) on this baseline set of data.  The NASA LEDAPS group has filled some of these larger data gaps by interpolating the missing data. If the ozone data is missing from the NASA ftp site, then the updatetoms script will not try to update that auxiliary file.
```
    tar -xvzf ledaps_aux.1978-2014.tar.gz
```

  * Setup the environment variables for the auxiliary files
```
    export LEDAPS_AUX_DIR="directory_saved_auxiliary_files"
    (or in c shell use 
    setenv LEDAPS_AUX_DIR "directory_saved_auxiliary_files")
```

  * Setup additional environment variables needed for building the auxiliary download applications
```
  export NCDF4INC="path_to_netCDF4_include_files"
  export NCDF4LIB="path_to_netCDF4_libraries"
  export HDF5INC="path_to_HDF5_include_files"
  export HDF5LIB="path_to_HDF5_libraries"
  export CURLINC="path_to_CURL_include_files"
  export CURLLIB="path_to_CURL_libraries"
  export IDNINC="path_to_IDN_include_files"
  export IDNLIB="path_to_IDN_libraries"
```

  * Download (from Github USGS-EROS surface-reflectance project) and install source files. The following build will create a list of executable files under $PREFIX/bin (tested in Linux with the gcc and gfortran compiler). It will also copy various scripts from the scripts directory to the $PREFIX/bin directory.
```
    cd ledaps\ledapsSrc\src
    make
    make install
    make clean

    cd ledaps\ledapsAncSrc
    make
    make install
    make clean
```

  * Test - Download Landsat Level 1 files.  Run the do\_ledaps Python script in the LEDAPS bin directory to run the applications.  Use do\_ledaps.py --help for the usage information.  This script requires that your LEDAPS binaries are in your $PATH or that you have a $BIN environment variable set up to point to the LEDAPS bin directory.
```
    convert_lpgs_to_espa --mtl <Landsat_MTL_file> --xml <Landsat_ESPA_XML_file>
    do_ledaps.py --xml <Landsat_ESPA_XML_file>
```

  * Check output
```
    {scene_name}_toa_*: top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in internal ESPA file format (brightness temperatures are _toa_band6*)
    {scene_name}_sr_*: surface reflectance in internal ESPA file format
```

### Dependencies
  * ESPA raw binary and ESPA common libraries from ESPA product formatter and associated dependencies
  * XML2 library
  * Auxiliary data products
    1. NCEP water vapor, air pressure, air temperature data
    2. TOMS ozone data
    3. CMGDEM HDF file (GTOPO5)

### Auxiliary Data Updates
This baseline auxiliary files provided are good into 2014.  In order to update the auxiliary files to the most recent day of year (actually the most current auxiliary files available will be 2-3 days prior to the current day of year do to the latency of the underlying NCEP and TOMS products) the user will want to run the updatencep.py and updatetoms.py scripts available in $PREFIX/bin.  Both scripts can be run with the "--help" argument to print the usage information for each script.  In general the --quarterly argument will reprocess/update all the NCEP/TOMS data back to 1978.  This is good to do every once in a while to make sure any updates to the NCEP or TOMS data products are captured.  The --today command-line argument will process the NCEP/TOMS data for the most recent year.  In general, it is suggested to run the scripts with --quarterly once a quarter.  Then run the scripts with --today on a nightly basis.  This should provide an up-to-date version of the auxiliary input data for LEDAPS.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to set up a nightly and quarterly cron job.

### Data Preprocessing
This version of the LEDAPS application requires the input Landsat products to be in the ESPA internal file format.  After compiling the espa-common raw\_binary libraries and tools, the convert\_lpgs\_to\_espa command-line tool can be used to create the ESPA internal file format for input to the LEDAPS application.

### Data Postprocessing
After compiling the product-formatter raw\_binary libraries and tools, the convert\_espa\_to\_gtif and convert\_espa\_to\_hdf command-line tools can be used to convert the ESPA internal file format to HDF or GeoTIFF.  Otherwise the data will remain in the ESPA internal file format, which includes each band in the ENVI file format (i.e. raw binary file with associated ENVI header file) and an overall XML metadata file.

## Release Notes
  * All
    1. Confirmed the L1T filenames are supported for both the legacy L1T
       filenames as well as the new Landsat Collection filenames.
  * lndsr
    1. The SrInterpAtmCoef function in sr.c spends time computing 13
       coefficients for the current pixel, however 4 of those coefficients are
       not used in the application (td_r, tu_r, S_r, rho_r).  Instead the
       coefficients from the 6S table are used for these variables.  Therefore
       the interpolation of these variables is commented out to save processing
       time.
  * lndcal
    1. The lndcal application handles "zooming" the thermal bands to the same
       resolution as the reflectance bands.  This code is obsolete, given that
       the thermal and reflective bands are all the same resolution.  The code
       which handles the zooming has been pulled from lndcal for easier
       maintenance.
